      <p class="about-text">Thanks for stopping by! I'm a software developer with a passion for building things and solving problems.</p>
      <p class="about-text">I enjoy tackling problems head-on, and building things that automate the boring stuff and make people's lives easier. I've always taken an interest in how things work, and I began to take an interest in building software during my time in business school, and later, consulting. What began as a hobby became a passion, and I decided to pursue a career as a developer in 2021. In the years since, I've worked as a full-stack developer in the consulting industry, serving primarily government clients.</p>
      <p class="about-text">In my leisure time, I love sports, films, books, crossword puzzles, and spending time with friends and loved ones.</p>
